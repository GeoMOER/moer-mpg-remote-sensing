title: "Spotlight: Poster Presentation"

Posters presentations are visually supported social interactions between you and your peers. A posters is your supporting medium, not the only medium of the presentation. Hence, go for the key message, the key figures, the key links and save up the smallest details for the discussion.

## A graphical abstract of your scientific work
Scientific communication has many facets and ranges from book our journal publications to oral presentations or from posters to videos and web blogs. Each of these communication practices has its own character and social interaction potential. Hence, a poster presentation is a unique format which should be handled as uniquely as any other scientific communication. 

The most important thing when designing a poster is to keep in mind that it is not called poster exhibition but poster session as in *the poster must not be fully self explaining but you stand next to your poster and present and discuss your work to and with your peers*.

## Some starting points and examples
The following references will provide a good basis for making up your mind about how you are going to present your work and design a good supporting poster for it:
* Erren & Bourne (2007) stated 10 simple rules for a good poster presentation. Most of these focus on the design of the poster itself.
* Powell (2012) writes about the "billboard science" and adds the social interaction aspects of a poster (supported) presentation.
* Woolston (2016) focuses a bit more on the amount of text on a poster and how to create it (and aside from the fact that he is right, PowerPoint or similar is still one of the tools to use if you do not work alone just because of its market share).
* The [Better Posters Blog](https://betterposters.blogspot.com/){:target="_blank"} provides many examples on good posters, new ideas and some dropped bricks.

Use the references and examples as means in finding your own way to a good poster presentation. The tips are no rules, they are guidlines you could build upon. Please, keep your individuality and your ability to learn from previous experience as e.g. Vasco Elbrecht (who is mentioned in Woolston (2016) above) who has started with overloaded posters but ended with a poster award and who shows some of his posters in the video below.

To end with an example from our faculty, the following shows a poster from a project review. The challenge was to create a poster about something you have not done yet, but you intend to do. The individual sections have been added with an eye on potential discussions with reviewers who would finally decide if the project will be granted or not. It follows some rules you will find in the above references but not all of them. Just take some time to have a look at it and make up your own mind about some positive and negative aspects of it.

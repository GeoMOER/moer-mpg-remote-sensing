Field surveys face the compromise between level of detail, extend and temporal repetition. One can study selected processes in detail on a very limited number of observation sites or focus on a landscape survey using generalized observations. The restrictions loosen when linking survey information to area wide remote sensing observations and the modelling of raster maps as basis for scientific analysis. 

Remote sensing has a history of more than 150 years. It is well established and cost-effective but must be applied with caution to gain robust results. The advent of artificial intelligence has opened a new chapter in data mining and information retrieval. Profound skills in data handling, machine learning, team-based software development, workflow documentation and presentation and discussion of result are required.

#  Geo Information Science Basics

The basic information and general introduction to the conception of this and the parallel [Remote Sensing Course](https://geomoer.github.io//moer-mpg-remote-sensing/) are available at [Geo Information Science Basics](https://geomoer.github.io//moer-mpg-rsgi-basics/). 

They are an integral and binding part of this course.

# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able

* to research remote sensing methods and design workflows suitable to solve common remote sensing problems,
* to deploy your remote sensing workflows using geo-information science tools, R scripts and collaborative code management platforms for task management and issue tracking, 
* to critically evaluate your remote sensing analysis,
* to document and communicate your remote sensing workflow and analysis results,
* to reflect your project workflow for potential improvements.



# Course features

The course is linked to the parallel [Geo Information Systems](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_1656074&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"} and build upon the parallel [Data Analysis](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_1655946&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"} courses. It is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too. Data and examples in this course focus on Marburg Open Forest - the open research and learning forest of Marburg University - and are related to the LOEWE Priority Programm [Nature 4.0](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb19/natur40){:target="_blank"}.

# Deliverables

The graded course certificate will be based on a portfolio. The individual portfolio items are defined in the course assignments along with information if they will be marked or not. The marked portfolio item will be an article following the type "Practical Tools" (but up to 2,000 words) of Methods in Ecology and Evolution.


# Preparation and prerequisites

The courses assumes basic knowledge and skills in remote sensing and GIS. Required R Remote Sensing and GIS skills can be developed by the parallel courses [Data Analysis](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-mpg-remote-sensing/){:target="_blank"}, [Geo Information Systems]( geomoer.github.io/moer-mpg-gis/){:target="_blank"} and [Remote Sensing]( geomoer.github.io/moer-mpg-remote-sensing/){:target="_blank"}.

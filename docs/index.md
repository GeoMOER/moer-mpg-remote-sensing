  excerpt: "At the end of this course you should be able
  
    * to research remote sensing methods and design workflows suitable to solve common remote sensing problems,

	* to deploy your remote sensing workflows using geo-information science tools, R scripts and collaborative code management platforms for task management and issue tracking, 

	* to critically evaluate your remote sensing analysis,
	
	* to document and communicate your remote sensing workflow and analysis results,

	* to reflect your project workflow for potential improvements.

Field surveys generally face the compromise between their level of detail, their extend and their temporal repetition. One can either study selected processes in detail on a very limited number of observation sites or focus on a more landscape oriented survey using more generalized observations. The restrictions can be loosened by linking survey information to area wide remote sensing observations and the modelling of raster maps which can further be used for scientific analysis. 

Remote sensing has a history of more than 150 years and is a well established, cost-effective and powerful tool but it has to be applied with caution in order to gain robust results. The advent of high performance computing along with machine learning algorithms has just opened up a new chapter in data mining and information retrieval using a wide variety of ground-based, airborne and satellite sensors. This requires a large variety of skills related to data handling, machine learning, team-based software development and workflow documentation and the presentation and discussion of results.

# Course features

The course is linked to the research of the Nature 4.0 project, heavily integrated into the parallel [Geo Information Systems](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=327&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"} and build upon the parallel [Data Analysis](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=326&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"} courses. It is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.

# Deliverables

The graded course certificate will be based on a team portfolio hosted as a team repository on GitHub. The individual portfolio items are defined in the respective course assignments along with the information if they will be marked or not. Marked portfolio items encompass the presentation and peer-review of two posters which inform about the results of two problem solving assignments related to the computation and analysis of remote sensing products.


# Preparation and prerequisites

The courses assumes basic knowledge and skills in remote sensing and GIS. Required R and GIS skills can be developed by the parallel courses [Data Analysis](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=326&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"} and [Geo Information Systems](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=327&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"}.

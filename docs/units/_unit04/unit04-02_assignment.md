title: "Marked Assignment: Project II - Tree species prediction"
---

This worksheet introduces your second project which aims in the spatial prediction of tree species to create a map of tree species in Marburg Open Forest and use this result for further analysis in the parallel [Geo Information Systems (GIS)](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_327&client_id=mriliasmooc){:target="_blank"} course.

## Things you need for this worksheet
  * [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} — the interpreter can be installed on any operation system.
  * [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} — we recommend to use R Studio for (interactive) programming with R.
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){:target="_blank"} environment for your operating system. For Windows users with little experience on the command line we recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/){:target="_blank"}.
  * Results from your first project in this and the neighbouring GIS course.
  * Many other things depending on your specific workflow and analysis design.
  
## Project for compiling a tree species map for Marburg Open Forest
The second project aims in using the data from the first projects of this (comprehensive remote sensing dataset) and the GIS (tree crown segmentation)course to predict tree species from remotely sensed observations and create a tree species map for Marburg Open Forest. Naturally, feel free to include or compile anything else you need for completing this project.

Remember the exemplary publication from the first project on detecting woody vegetation in South Africa [Ludwig et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243416300265){:target="_blank"} but also keep in mind the things you learned in the parallel Data Anylsis course.

Please compile a tree species map for Marburg Open Forest and present your project at the end of this course.

## A note on team learning log assignments with GitHub
Within this course, you will use R markdown, html and/or pdf files for submitting your course assignments to your GitHub-hosted learning log. For details please refer to the parallel [Data analysis course](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_326&client_id=mriliasmooc). 

Within this course, you will work in teams and hence you will always have team based assignments which you will have to submit to the team classroom repository at GitHub. Your team repositories will be created automatically by following a link to the classroom assignment which will be provided by the instructors. They will be hosted as part of GeoMOER, our learning log space at GitHub for Marburg Open Educational Ressources.

To start with, get yourself a GitHub account if you have not one already and create your team learning log using the link provided by the course lecturers. Be aware that once the team is created, you will stick to this team until the end of the course.

Aside from submitting assignments, you should use your team repository for everything related to this course which is a potential subject to version control, team collaboration and issue tracking.

## A note on team assignments in education
Please remember that also this course uses team assignments, it is very important that each team member knows what and how to do it. Hence, our very strong suggestion is the following: First, try to solve each task at hand individually. Second, meet as a team and share your individual solutions. Help each other, leaf no one behind, discuss problems, pros and cons and build the final team-based solution which will be the one which is submitted and/or forms the basis for the next task in your problem solving workflow. In doing so you will get the maximum from this course because learning and training your skills is most effective in problem-based and peer-to-peer scenarios.

Another important aspect is reliably and punctually. Each team mate depends on all others. Keep your team work smooth by assigning at least these two roles to your team members:
  
  * Team manager: this person is responsible for the overall team work, project management, discussion management, disciplinary measures (e.g. paying the pizza service bill).
  * Time manager: this person is responsible for managing group appointments (something like a jour fixe would be a perfect option) and keeping the time line of the project and deadlines in mind in order to inform the team manager if something is delayed.
  * Record manager: this person is responsible for keeping notes and the coordination of creating reports or presentations.
  * Cross-check manager: this person is responsible for cross-checking the final products, scripts, solutions prior to submission.

Over time you should switch roles between your team mates.

Please do not take any shortcuts here, just do it right and take as much from this course as you can.

## Mandatory working environment
We value freedom of choice as an important good but giving our long-term experience freedom of choice comes to an end when we talk about the mandatory working environment for this course. The reason for this is simple: you work with team-based assignments and a piece of code written on the laptop of person A should run basically without any or very minor changes (i.e. a change of the top level directory path where all your scripts, data, results etc. are stored) on the computer of person B. The situation gets more nasty if you should test some code of a peer which is not part of your team or if the instructors would like to run your script on their own system. Hence, let's save everybody's time and focus on the things which are really important. Once the course is finished, feel free to use any working environment structure you like.

You find details on the initial setup in the info on working environment. Your environment will grow over time based on additional information supplied within the individual assignments. 

This is no guideline, this is a rule. Read it, learn it, live it and have a nice ride.

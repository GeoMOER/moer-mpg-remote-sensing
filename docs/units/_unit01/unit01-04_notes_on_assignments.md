## A note on learning log assignments with GitHub
Within this module, we will use R markdown files for submitting the solutions of worksheets like this to your GitHub-based learning log. For details please refer to the parallel [Data analysis course](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_326&client_id=mriliasmooc). 

Within this course, you will work in teams and hence you will have team based assignments which you will have to submit to the team classroom repository at GitHub.

Your team repositories will be created automatically by following a link to the respective classroom assignment which will be provided by the instructors. They will be hosted as part of GeoMOER, our learning log space at GitHub for Marburg Open Educational Ressources.

To start with, get yourself a GitHub account if you have not one already and create your personal learning log using the link provided by the course lecturers.

## A note on team based assignments
Please be aware that also this course uses team based assignments, it is very important that each team member knows what and how to do it. Hence, our very strong suggestion is the following: First, try to solve each task at hand individually. Second, meet as a team and share your individual solutions. Help each other, leaf no one behind, discuss pros and cons and build the final team-based solution which will be the one which is submitted and/or forms the basis for the next task.

In doing so you will get the maximum from this course because learning and training your skills is most effective in problem-based and peer-to-peer scenarios.

Another important aspect is reliably and punctually. Each team mate depends on all others. Keep your team work smooth by assigning at least these two roles to your team members:
  
  * Team manager: this person is responsible for the overall team work, project progress, disciplinary measures (e.g. paying the pizza service bill)
  * Time manager: this person is responsible for keeping the time line of the project

Over time you should switch roles between your team mates.

Please do not take any shortcuts here, just do it right and take as much from this course as you can.

## Mandatory working environment
We value freedom of choice as an important good but giving our long-term experience freedom of choice comes to an end when we talk about the mandatory working environment for this course. The reason for this is simple: you work with team-based assignments and a piece of code written on the laptop of person A should run basically without any or very minor changes (i.e. a change of the top level directory path where all your scripts, data, results etc. are stored) on the computer of person B. The situation gets more nasty if you should test some code of a peer which is not part of your team or if the instructors would like to run your script on their own system. Hence, let's save everybody's time and focus on the things which are really important. Once the course is finished, feel free to use any working environment structure you like.

Please create the following folder structure in your GitHub checkout: ''data_analysis/unit_01''. Please note that ''unit_01'' is a sub-folder of ''data_analysis'' which in turn is a sub-folder of your main repository folder (i.e. the one you get from the link provided by the lecturers). 

Keep to this strucutre, do not add or delete something, include spaces or capitalize folder names. **At no time**. **Never**.

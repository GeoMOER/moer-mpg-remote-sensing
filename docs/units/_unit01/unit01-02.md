Conservation monitoring through networked sensors as a basis for sustainable biodiversity protection and securing ecosystem functions.

## Overview of Nature 4.0
The following slides (in German) introduce you to the Nature 4.0 project. Nature 4.0 develops a next-generation conservation monitoring through networked sensors as a basis for sustainable biodiversity protection and securing ecosystem functions. In case you miss this session, you find some more information below.

## Nature 4.0 in a nutshell

### Basis
Conservation strategies require the observation and assessment of landscape. Expert surveys have to made a compromise between the level of detail, spatial coverage and temporal repetition, which can only partially be resolved by including aircraft or satellite-based remote sensing approaches. This restricts differentiated nature conservation planning and reaction options.

### Goals of the LOEWE Focus Nature 4.0
The objective of Nature 4.0 is the development of a prototype of Natur 4.0, a modular environmental monitoring system for the high-resolution observation of conservation-relevant species, habitats and processes. Nature 4.0 is based on the combination of nature conservation expert surveys and networked remote sensing and environmental sensors, which are attached to remote-controlled aircrafts, rover robots and animals and also used within educational science projects. Together with powerful data integration and data analysis methods, Natur 4.0 enables the differentiated and effective observation of landscape. The recorded time series also serve to develop early warning indicators. Nature 4.0 is thus breaking new ground in the field of comprehensive environmental monitoring. It condenses the in-situ investigations of experts and uses non-regular data collection with mobile platforms to model nature conservation information in the form of regular, small-scale differentiated raster maps.

### Interdisciplinary Research
The goal, which can only be achieved through a cross-disciplinary network, connects scientists from geography, computer science, mathematics and ecology with nature conservation experts from the private sector and administration. It bridges the gap between basic research and applied research and involves schools and citizens in scientific research. The innovation potential sharpens the profile area "Biodiversity and Climate" of the Philipps University as well as the profile area "Climate and Climate Impact Research" of the research campus Mittelhessen and complements the existing expertise. Thus, Nature 4.0 strengthens the location Hessen and provides an innovative instrument for environmental observation.

title: Remote Sensing in Environmental Research and Conservation
---

This unit examines the role of remote sensing in environmental research and nature conservation by introducing the concept of the Nature 4.0 project. The course activities will take place within *Marburg Open Forest*, the forest are of Marburg University which provides an open space for research and education.

## Remote sensing in scientific literature
Remote sensing has many flavors and fields of application. To get a better idea of this, the following links will route you to journal homepages where you can explore some of the latest publications:

## Integrating research and education
The philosophy of this course interlinks real world science with the Master education program. Hence, the problems you will solve during this course are real world problems and the solutions you will provide might make an actual contribution to ongoing research activities. This is why the next section will introduce you to the Nature 4.0 project on sensing biodiversity.

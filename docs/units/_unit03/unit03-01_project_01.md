---

Design a project aiming in the computation of a comprehensive image collection for tree delineation, species prediction, and heterogeneity mapping.

## Learning objectives
At the end of your project you should be able to
* process optical data to compile a comprehensive dataset for your area of interest,
* compute artificial images which highlight spectral, structural or spatial properties,
* design and implement medium complex workflows related to artificial image computations,
* work in teams on short-term projects and use collaborative project and software development tools,
* sufficiently document your code and analysis workflow for re-usability and scientific review,
* compute land-cover classifications using R packages like caret to build a model for the prediction of the selected tree species classes,
* discuss the principal logic and required steps of training a machine learning model,
* understand the importance of appropriate training site selection strategies,
* discuss strategies on which predictor variables to include in a classification model,
* communicate your work in a poster presentation.

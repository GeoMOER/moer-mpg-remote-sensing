More information on the tree crown assignment and the forest structure project will be supplied in the parallel GIS course. To get an idea on the remote sensing based species prediction or spatial prediction project in general, the publication of [Ludwig et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243416300265){:target="_blank"} on detecting woody vegetation in South Africa can be one starting point (by the way, this publication is the result of the B.Sc. thesis of Annika).

## Building a comprehensive remote sensing dataset
Please compile a comprehensive dataset based on spectral and structural information derived from both multi-channel aerial and LiDAR datasets which is suitable for the parallel and upcoming project work mentioned above. The dataset should provide information on
* spectral properties,
* structural properties,
* spatial patterns of spectral and structural properties.

## Tree Species Map for Marburg Open Forest

Naturally, feel free to include or compile anything else you need for completing this project.

Remember the exemplary publication from the first project on detecting woody vegetation in South Africa [Ludwig et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243416300265){:target="_blank"} but also keep in mind the things you learned in the parallel Data Anylsis course.

Please use the upcoming spotlight units as a sort of guideline and a source of inspiration for the compilation.

Please start working on your article in parallel, focusing on the introduction and the methods chapter. Both chapters must be presented in session 8.

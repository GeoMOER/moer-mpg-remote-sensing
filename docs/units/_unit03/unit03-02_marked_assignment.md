title: ""Graded Assignment RS Project"
---



Please develop a project that at least uses the results and data from the course work (ungraded assignment) to answer a self-chosen (research) question. 

This question can emphasize the methodological aspects or address an application-focused problem. 

If enrolled in both courses, the GI findings must be integrated.


Please consider the principles of transparency, reproducibility and communication mentioned in the basics. That is, the source code should be available on GitHub and the resulting article should follow the usual conventions of good scientific practice. 

The graded course certificate will be an article following the type “Practical Tools” (but up to 3,000 words) of Methods in Ecology and Evolution that describes the project from its motivation and intention over the methods and results to the discussion of the final information. 

There will only be one article for both courses (the remote sensing and the GIS course).

* [Practical Tools Blog](https://methodsblog.com/tag/practical-tools/)

Even if pretty much more comprehensive The following publications can be used as inspiration for the article.
* [Improved Classification of Urban Trees Using a Widespread Multi-Temporal Aerial Image Dataset ](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12152475)
* [Individual Tree Crown Delineation from UAS Imagery Based on Region Growing and Growth Space Considerations](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/15/2363) 
* [Quantifying Understory and Overstory Vegetation Cover Using UAV-Based RGB Imagery in Forest Plantation](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12020298)


Please note that it should be a *short* communication. The page number of your article should be clearly less than ten pages.

### Further Notes

Remember the exemplary publication from the first project on detecting woody vegetation in South Africa [Ludwig et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243416300265){:target="_blank"} but also keep in mind the things you learned in the parallel Data Anylsis course.

Please use the upcoming spotlight units as a sort of guideline and a source of inspiration for the compilation.

Please start working on your article in parallel, focusing on the introduction and the methods chapter. Both chapters must be presented in session 8.

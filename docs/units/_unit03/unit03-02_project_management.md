## A note on project management
Creativity in research and project management are not incompatible. In fact, most if not all research requires the definition of some kind of aim or the organization of tasks in time schedules. Project requirements that define tasks might not be developed or even known at some stage of the project but project management is not a stiff corset. 

Common project management steps are:
* Define the project and its goals,
* Break down the project into tasks and define a schedule,
* Design workflows for each task and implement them,
* Adjust your tasks, solve problems and be flexible.

While many project management solutions are available, the GitHub project board feature might be all you ever need at least during your course of study.

For a more detailed look, see e.g. the paper of [(Portny & Austin 2002)](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2002/07/project-management-scientists){:target="_blank"} cited above on project management for scientists.

## A note on software development in scientific analysis
You already got in contact with Git version control and the issue tracker and project board features of GitHub. These tools also allow full flexibility and at the same time ensure that your workflow and analysis progress is transparent, documented and re-usable. While there are many flavors of agile software management strategies out there, they can basically all be mapped to the project features of GitHub. For an overview see e.g. the [Wikipedia entry on agile project development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development){:target="_blank"} or the [manifesto for Agile data science](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/a-manifesto-for-agile-data-science){:target="_blank"} on the O'Reilly blog for a starter).

Deciding if an analysis workflow is directly included into a script or into an easier reusable function is not always simple. For starters, if you already know that you will need a certain computation feature several times for different input datasets, the function is likely the better solution.

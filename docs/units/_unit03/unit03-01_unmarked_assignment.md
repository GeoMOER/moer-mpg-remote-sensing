## Skills and Competences

At the end of your ungraded assignment project you should be able to:
* process optical raster data to compile a comprehensive dataset for your area of interest
* compute artificial images which highlight spectral, structural or spatial properties using the cpabilities of R and more (e.g. OTB)
* design and implement medium complex workflows related to raster based image computations
* work with collaborative project and software development tools
* sufficiently document your code and analysis workflow for re-usability and scientific review 
* compute land-cover classifications using R packages like caret to build a model for the prediction of the selected tree species classes
* discuss the principal logic and required steps of training a machine learning model,
* understand the importance of appropriate training site selection strategies,
* discuss strategies on which predictor variables to include in a classification model,
* communicate your work in a poster presentation.

## Comprehensive dataset for Classification purposes
Please compile a comprehensive dataset based on spectral and structural information derived from both multi-channel aerial and LiDAR datasets which is suitable for the parallel and upcoming project work mentioned above. The dataset should provide information on:
* spectral properties
* structural properties
* spatial patterns 

## Tree species Classification
Please design and perform a classification workflow to identify the tree species in MOF on pixel resolution using a ML approach. You should provide:
* tree species classification for Marburg Open Forest
* training and validation strategy

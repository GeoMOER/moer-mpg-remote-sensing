title: "Marked Assignment: Project"
---

This worksheet introduces your first project which aims in the compilation of a comprehensive dataset for further analysis in this and the parallel [Geo Information Systems (GIS)](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_327&client_id=mriliasmooc){:target="_blank"} course.

## Things you need for this worksheet
  * [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} — the interpreter can be installed on any operation system.
  * [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} — we recommend to use R Studio for (interactive) programming with R.
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){:target="_blank"} environment for your operating system. For Windows users with little experience on the command line we recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/){:target="_blank"}.
  * Datasets provided by the course instructors.
  * Many other things depending on your specific workflow and analysis design.
  
## The big picture
The data resulting from this first project will form the input dataset for a series of follow-up projects located in the area of Marburg Open Forest:
1. Tree crown segmentation (GIS, parallel time frame )
1. Prediction of tree species (this course, consecutive to this project and 1.)
1. Forest structure and tree competition (GIS, parallel to 2.)

This cross-linking of the project works has an important implication on the planing of this project. One cannot specify the actual dataset requirements at this stage and but one must iteratively adjust the requirements based on insights and knowledge gained in the parallel work. Hence, this dual project workflow acts quite similar to other knowledge gaps one might have at the beginning of a project, e.g related to computing images based on focal operations. Acting under this uncertainty is a key competence and nothing to panic about as long as one keeps it in mind.

More information on the tree crown assignment and the forest structure project will be supplied in the parallel GIS course. To get an idea on the remote sensing based species prediction or spatial prediction project in general, the publication of [Ludwig et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243416300265){:target="_blank"} on detecting woody vegetation in South Africa can be one starting point (by the way, this publication is the result of the B.Sc. thesis of Annika).

## Project assignment
Please compile a comprehensive dataset based on spectral and structural information derived from both multi-channel aerial and LiDAR datasets which is suitable for the parallel and upcoming project work mentioned above. The dataset should provide information on
* spectral properties,
* structural properties,
* spatial patterns of spectral and structural properties.

Please use the upcoming spotlight units as a sort of guideline and a source of inspiration for the compilation.

Given the developing requirements in the parallel project and the knowledge gain of your team, include flexibility for continuous adaptations in your project management and software development (see e.g. the [Wikipedia entry on agile project development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development){:target="_blank"} or the [manifesto for Agile data science](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/a-manifesto-for-agile-data-science){:target="_blank"} on the O'Reilly blog for a starter).

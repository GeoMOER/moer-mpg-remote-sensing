Media literacy is a key skill for life-long learning and ongoing training your professional ability to act. This is why this course promotes to use existing information sources in the web and scientific literature whenever it is useful instead of producing the 1974th video on some topic or video recording the lecture sessions. In doing so, you could train your media literacy on the fly while learning more about a scientific topic. Please start and continue exploring the web for getting answers to your scientific questions and find help for your scientific problems.

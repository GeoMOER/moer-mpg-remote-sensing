## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to
* explain general factors which influence the optical remote sensing signal,
* explain the basic principle of LiDAR observations,
* basically organize your R files and consider some basic style guide rules and documentation minima,
* extend your project path environment by some folders and additional R libraries,
* crop individual raster images to an area of interest and merge them into one using R.


## Remote sensing using optical sensors
The following video introduces the topic of optical remote sensing using multi-/hyperspectral observations. It is part of the [National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://www.neonscience.org/){:target="_blank"} initiative on open data and information resources.

Media literacy is a key skill for life-long learning and ongoing training your professional ability to act. This is why this course promotes to use existing information sources in the web and scientific literature whenever it is useful instead of producing the 1974th video on some topic or video recording the lecture sessions. In doing so, you could train your media literacy on the fly while learning more about a scientific topic. Please start and continue exploring the web for getting answers to your scientific questions and find help for your scientific problems.

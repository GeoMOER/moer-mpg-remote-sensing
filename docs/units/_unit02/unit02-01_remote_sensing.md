title: Remote Sensing in a Nutshell
---

This unit refreshes the knowledge on remote sensing focusing on optical sensors and LiDAR examples. It also sets the ground for the upcoming project work by .

## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to
* explain general factors which influence the optical remote sensing signal
* explain the basic principle of LiDAR observations
* basically organize your R files and consider some basic style guide rules and documentation minima
* extend your project path environment by some folders and additional R libraries
* crop individual raster images to an area of interest and merge them into one using R
